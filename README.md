# Video Game
 Bouncing ball

	This is the video game project. There are two levels in this game and you have three life totally. And there is a time bar showing the time you have left. I suggest you to play the game and try not to lose any life in the first level, and then you can go to the second level. Or you can also lose three life and you will see a new page with “Game over” sign. You only need to use the mouse to control the paddle and you need to press the space key when the game stop (mostly because you lose one life). The life you have is shown on the top left of the frame. Sometimes the program will crash for no reason, please just open it again.
	
	The code is in a mess, maybe don't open it.
